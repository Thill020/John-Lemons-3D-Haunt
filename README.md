# John-Lemons-3D-Haunt
This project was an example legacy project where we had to complete the game using existing assets and post-processing effects.

This project was done as part of a Unity Programming class where we utilized some of the Unity online programming tutorials. 

At the time of downloading the start, the game still needed functionality for:
o What happens when you get caught.
o What happens if you make it through the mansion maze.
o Visual upgrades via post processing effects.

This project was my first real experience with trying to fully finish a project that was completed part way through, and needing to look through existing code to see how different aspects of the game worked.
